                <p>A yelp or craigslist type of website that enables anyone to do work or teach a subject of any kind. A review,
                    and certification system will be created to help new users prove their worth and get more job requests.

                <h3>by Emily Remy</h3>
                <p>Signlate is a user-friendly, two-way translation app that will translate not only English to ASL but also
                    ASL to English. It is meant to be a lifestyle app that can be tailored to the needs of its users. It
                    uses 3D modeling, instead of actors, allowing it to be updated with new words and dialects. SignLate's
                    main feature is how it allows you to look up a specific sign through keywords and tags to find its meaning
                    in English.

                <h3>by Sophie Wargo</h3>
                <p>This application asks users to select dietary options so it can return a proper meal accompanied with a wine
                    that would pair well based on flavors and ingredients. This project is currently in further development
                    with plans to have it allow users to save wine and meal pairings and share them on social media.

                <h2>Step Up & Inspire</h2>
                <h3>by Priya Vora</h3>
                <p>Several resources and platforms like Khan Academy, Udemy, and Pluralsight are available online in the strive
                    to make education easier for students. With the new technological changes and innovations around the
                    world, it is often difficult for educational organizations to provide students with updated resources
                    to enhance student's future. Many platforms that offer additional resources on educational and professional
                    subjects are often outdated, or not specific to most educational facilities. This process stagnates numerous
                    student's progress towards their academic and career success. This proposed invention focuses on providing
                    students a platform with resources, teacher's featuring tutorials, personal lock timer and a public messaging
                    system between students and teachers for their academic purposes. This technology will boost student's
                    motivation and focus to achieve their goals and develop their skills in various areas.

                <h3>by Morgan Smith</h3>
                <p>Publish.ME is an online service which improves the discoverability of talented writers. Too often great writers
                    disappear in the sea of mediocre writers, and they never see the light of day. Publish.ME elevates talented
                    writers, by customer desirability and AI, and presents them to professionals looking to buy stories.
